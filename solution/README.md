# SadaPay Case-Study / Supermarket Application

Case study of Super market application via Java 11, Maven with TDD approach for SadaPay company
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I m really appreciated that giving the chance to introduce myself and meet you. On the first interview,
I already mentioned that I have older experience on TDD and that didnt include all the best practises so this was a good chance
for me to remember and also try to deep dive into TDD and I spent much more time than I expected on researching and understanding TDD
so I didnt have a chance to cover all the possible test cases because of the time constraint but I tried to do my best like
I tried to apply some Design Patterns and principles and tried to make the code & architecture clean. I also had some ideas to apply some
other patterns but no time to test and cover all the cases. Hope the project and my TDD working style ll look fine for you as well.
As I mentioned on the first interview, I really want to improve myself on TDD professionally.

<b><i>Notes:</i></b>
<li> All the functionalities running properly.</li>
<li> All the test cases are GREEN.</li>
<li> I worked on Windows machine so it is important that it can be failure for finding the folder/file paths on Linux or Mac.</li>
